# Classi Landing Page
Classi is a landing page about furniture made with react, tailwindcss and a little bit of framer-motion.


## Inspiration 
I wanted to sharpen my react and tailwindcss skills so I took a Free figma  template from (https://templatesjungle.com/downloads/category/free-figma-resources/) and did my best to recreate the template.

  
## How to install
- clone this repo 
- open the repo with vscode 
- run the following commands :
```
npm install
npm run dev
```
