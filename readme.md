# Classi Landing Page
Classi is landing page about furniture made with react and tailwindcss with a little bot of framer-motion


## Inspiration 
I wanted to sharpen my react and tailwindcss skills so I took a Free figma  template from (https://templatesjungle.com/downloads/category/free-figma-resources/) and did my best to recreate the template.

## technologies used
- REACT
- TAILWINDCSS
- FRAMER-MOTION ( mostly for the hero section)
## How to install
- clone the repo 
- open the folder with vscode 
- run the command :
```
npm run dev
```
